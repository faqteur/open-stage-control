Client options can be set either with the server's `--client-options` option, or per client by adding query parameters to the server's url. One must prepend the url with a question mark (`?`) followed by `parameter=value` pairs separated with ampersands (`&`).

|----|----|----|----|
| hdpi | 1 / 0 | 0 | enable high resolution canvas |
| forceHdpi | number | 0 | force canvas scaling (ignore `hdpi`) |
| doubleTap | number | 375 | sets the double tap/click time threshold in milliseconds |
| zoom | number | 1 | sets the initial zoom |
| framerate | number | 60 | limit canvas drawing framerate |
| desyncCanvas | number | 0 | set to 1 to enable desynchronized canvas (may improve rendering performances) |
